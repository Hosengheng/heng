    You'll need this tag at the beginning of every <b> HTML </b> document you create. It ensures that a browser knows that it's reading HTML, and that it expects <b>HTML5</b>, the latest version.<br><br><br>
Even though this isn't actually an<b> HTML</b> tag, it's still a good one to know.

<h1>2. < html></h1>
<hr size="5" color="pink">

    This is another tag that tells a browser that it's reading ,<b>HTML</b>. The <html> tag goes
        <br> straight after the <b>DOCTYPE</b> tag, and you close it with a </html> tag right at the end of your <br>file.
          Everything else in your document goes between these tags.

    The â€¹head > tag starts the header section of your file. The stuff that goes in here doesn't <br>appear on your webpage. Instead, it contains metadata for search engines, and info for your browser.
